129,61.06172508378999,1.5,1.0,1.0,3.0,"Excellent safety. The trajectory correctly yields to the left-turning vehicle by slowing down, maintaining perfect lane discipline. The motion is smooth and comfortable. Efficiency is justifiably reduced to ensure safety.",1,1
540,452.0604597659594,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"Good balanced trajectory. It deviates slightly right to create space from the turning vehicle, maintaining good speed and comfort. A solid alternative to yielding.",4,2
492,222.1487614877167,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,"Acceptable safety. The deviation to the right is more pronounced than necessary, but it remains within the lane. Comfort and efficiency are good.",3,3
483,1026.3707478522279,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,"Poor safety. The trajectory deviates excessively to the right, hugging the lane line. This prioritizes efficiency over safety and comfort.",5,4
183,1098.8983414365619,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,"Poor safety. The trajectory swerves aggressively to the far right of the lane to maintain speed, compromising path adherence and comfort.",6,4
128,74.34730699918578,4.5,5.0,4.0,4.0,"Unacceptable safety. The trajectory steers left towards the oncoming turning vehicle, creating a high risk of collision. The maneuver is also uncomfortable and inefficient.",2,6
